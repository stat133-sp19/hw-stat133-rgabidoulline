### General Info
***

`"binomial"` is a R package that provides and implements functions for calculating the probabilities of a Binomial random variable. The package includes related calculations, including probability distribution, expected value, variance, and others.

* `bin_choose()` calculates the number of combinations in which *k* successes can occur in *n* trials.
* `bin_probability()` calculates the binomial probability of getting a certain number of successes in a given number of trials
* `bin_distribution()` returns a data frame of class `"bindis"` that returns the binomial probability distribution given a certain number of trials and probability of success
     - `plot.bindis()` method to display a histogram of a binomial distribution object `"bindis"`.
* `bin_cumulative()` returns a data frame of class `"bincum"` that returns the binomial probability distribution and cumulative distribution given a certain number of trials and probability of success
* `plot.bincum()` method to display a plot of a cumulative distribution object `"bincum"`.
* `bin_var()` creates a binomial random variable object of class `"binvar"`.
     - `print.binvar()` method to print the content of an object `"binvar"`.
     - `summary.binvar()` method to give a full summary description of an object `"binvar"`.
* `bin_mean` computes the mean of a binomial random variable given trials and probability
* `bin_variance` computes the variance of a binomial random variable given trials and probability
* `bin_mode` computes the mode of a binomial random variable given trials and probability
* `bin_skewness` computes the skewness of a binomial random variable given trials and probability
* `bin_kurtosis` computes the kurtosis of a binomial random variable given trials and probability

### Motivation
***

This package illustrates the creation of an R package through the lens of a binomial functions.

### Installation
***

Installation from GitHub with `"devtools"`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# install "binomial" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("stat133-sp19/hw-stat133-rgabidoulline/workout03/binomial/")

# install "binomial" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("stat133-sp19/hw-stat133-rgabidoulline/workout03/binomial/", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Usage
***

```{r}
library(binomial)

# k = 2 successes in n = 5 trials
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)

# probability of getting 2 successes in 5 trials
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)

# probability of 2 or less successes in 5 trials
bin_probability(success = 0:2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)

# binomial probability distribution
dist = bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
dist

# plot method
plot(dist)

# binomial cumulative distribution
cumdist = bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
cumdist

# plot method
plot(cumdist)

# binomial random variable
X = bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
X

# summary method
summary(X)

# mean of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_mean(10, 0.3)

# variance of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_variance(10, 0.3)

# mode of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_mode(10, 0.3)

# skewness of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)

# kurtosis of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
