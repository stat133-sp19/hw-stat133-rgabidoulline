## General Info about Binomial

`"binomial"` is a R package that provides and implements functions for calculating the probabilities of a Binomial random variable. The package includes related calculations, including probability distribution, expected value, variance, and others.


## First Steps: Choose Function and Calculating Probability

The `bin_choose()` function is an implementation of the **choose** function, which calculates the number of combinations in which *k* successes can occur in *n* trials.

```{r}
# k = 2 successes in n = 5 trials
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
```

We can use the `bin_probability()` function to calculate the binomial probability of getting a certain number of successes in a given number of trials. For instance, if the probability of success is 0.5, the probability of getting 2 successes in 5 trials is:

```{r}
# probability of getting 2 successes in 5 trials
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

## Probability Distribution and Cumulative Distribution

We can calculate the binomial probability distribution given certain parameters of number of successes and number of trials with the `bin_distribution()` function. This will output a table with every possible number of successes and the corresponding probability of this many successes. For instance, we can calculate the probability distribution given 5 trials and probability of success 0.5:

```{r}
# binomial probability distribution
dist = bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
dist
```

We can then plot this distribution using the `plot.bindis()` method:

```{r}
# plot method
plot(dist)
```

We can also compute the cumulative distribution given the same parameters using `bin_cumulative()`. This distribution gives the cumulative probability up to a certain number of successes. For example the cumulative distribution table given 5 trials and probability of success 0.5 is:

```{r}
# binomial cumulative distribution
cumdist = bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
cumdist
```

We can then plot this distribution using the `plot.bincum()` method:

```{r}
# plot method
plot(cumdist)
```

## Creating a Binomial Random Variable

We can also use the `bin_variable()` function to create a **Binomial Random Variable**. The function will output a table with the corresponding probability distribution of this object. For example, to create a binomial random variable with parameters of 10 trials and probability of success 0.3:

```{r}
# binomial random variable
X = bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
X
```

The `summary.binvar()` function gives a nice summary of the parameters of a binomial random variable, as well as the measures of the variable, such as mean, variance, etc.

```{r}
# summary method
summary(X)
```

## Functions of Measures

Finally, this package provides functions of measures for binomial distributions. These functions globally take as inputs the number of trials and the probability of success.  

`bin_mean()` gives the mean of a binomial distribution. For instance, given 10 trials and probability of success 0.3, the mean is:

```{r}
# mean of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_mean(10, 0.3)
```

`bin_variance()` gives the variance of a binomial distribution. For instance, given 10 trials and probability of success 0.3, the variance is:

```{r}
# variance of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
```

`bin_mode()` gives the mode of a binomial distribution. For instance, given 10 trials and probability of success 0.3, the mode is:

```{r}
# mode of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
```

`bin_skewness()` gives the skewness of a binomial distribution. For instance, given 10 trials and probability of success 0.3, the skewness is:

```{r}
# skewness of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
```

`bin_kurtosis()` gives the kurtosis of a binomial distribution. For instance, given 10 trials and probability of success 0.3, the kurtosis is:

```{r}
# kurtosis of distribution with trials = 10 and prob = 0.3
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
